    <h2>Why Code?</h2>
    <p>While this may seem like a simple question on the surface, a lot more goes into my answer. Now like most young adults entering the so-called "real world" I had very little idea what to do with my life. At first it was aerospace engineering, then it was biology, and as I continue to learn and mature, who knows what else I may be interested in. This seemingly impossible task of picking a career was simplified by asking a different question. What did I like to do? I knew that I enjoyed meticulous reseach and problem solving. I knew that I was a highly analytical person. I also knew that I had a natural ability to learn whatever I set my sights on. With these new answers, the originally problem was solved. I now knew that I wanted to become a computer programmer. </p>
